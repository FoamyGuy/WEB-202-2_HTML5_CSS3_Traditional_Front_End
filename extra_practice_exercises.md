This file contains a list of extra practice exercises that are not included in the book.

We may work on some of these during class if time permits but likely will not complete all of them.

You are free to complete these exercises outside of class and then bring them to me to look over or offer help if you get stuck.

- Code a page that includes images and text. It can be about yourself, or a hobby or something else  that you enjoy. For extra practice create multiple pages that are linked together with anchor links.
- Create a Recipe page. At a minimum it should include an unordered list of ingredents and an ordered list of steps
- contact form (name, email, message, submit button)
- login page (username password, extra practice: links for reset password, and site logo)
- sign up form (username,  email, password, password repeat, extra practice security question choice and answer input)
- create Horizontal and/or vertical navigation links styled to look nice. For extra practice use CSS to add hover effects to embelish the entry that the mouse is over
- code an Image Gallery page that includes a grid of images each with a short description. You can use placeholders instead of real images if you'd like
- Code a basic about page that includes an image and some paragraphs of information about a company you can make up a fake company if you'd like
